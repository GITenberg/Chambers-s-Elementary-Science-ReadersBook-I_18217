<p>1. Pussy came walking along the garden-path.
Harry watched her, and saw
that she did not like the damp ground.</p>

<p>2. She jumped over the pools, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
then began to run, shaking her paws
as she got to the house.</p>

<p>3. 'Now, a dog does not mind wet
feet,' Harry thought; 'he will go into
the water, but Pussy will never go into
the water.</p>

<p>4. 'She does not even use water to
wash herself. Come here, Pussy! You
don't like to wet your nice fur, do you?'</p>

<p>5. As Harry was always kind to pussy,
she let him pick her up and carry her
into the house.</p>

<p>6. He sat down on the rug with her,
and stroked her glossy back. One of
her fore-paws rested on his hand, and
he began to look at it.</p>

<p>7. 'Here are five toes,' he said,
'but what funny toes they are!' He
gently turned the paw over, and saw
the sharp nails drawn in under the fur.</p>

<p>8. The cat knew that he would not
hurt her, so she kept her claws in, and
let him feel them on the outside.</p>

<p>9. He found under the paw a soft
smooth pad. 'Now I know how it is
that she can walk so softly!' he said.
'This must help her to walk in that way.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Here pussy gave a great yawn, and
stretched out both her paws, claws and
all. Harry saw the
sharp nails like hooks,
and watched them go
back into their
sheaths. Then she
curled herself up on
his lap.</p>

<p>11. He took hold of
one of her hind-feet,
and found only four
toes upon it. 'I wonder
if this is a mistake,' he said, 'or
if the other one is the same.' Yes, it
was just the same: there were four
toes, with a claw at the end of each.</p>

<p>1. 'What long sharp teeth she has
got!' cried Harry, as pussy sat up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
opened her mouth. 'They look like
knives. There are two at the top, and
two at the bottom!</p>

<p>2. 'I should not like my finger to be
in the way when you shut your mouth.
Your teeth must be for tearing and
cutting: I am sure you do not chew
your food as I have to do.</p>

<p>3. 'And what a way you have of
drinking!</p>

<p>'Here, pussy, would you like some
milk?' said Harry, and getting up, he
poured a little milk into a clean saucer.</p>

<p>4. The cat ran to it, and Harry went
down on the floor close by to watch her
drinking it.</p>

<p>5. He saw that pussy's tongue was
not smooth like his own, but had tiny
points all over it. It came into his mind
that she had once licked his face, and
her tongue had a 'scrapy' feeling.</p>

<p>6. 'Do it again, pussy, dear,' he said,
but she went on lapping up the milk.</p>

<p>'May I touch your tongue, then, with
one of my fingers?'</p>

<p>7. But pussy did not like this. Then
Harry took a drop or two of the milk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
into the palm of his hand. And when
the cat had taken all she had in the
saucer, she came and licked up the milk
in his hand.</p>

<p>8. She went on licking even when all
was gone, and Harry was able in this
way to feel how rough her tongue was.</p>

<p>9. Just then his mother came into
the kitchen, and Harry told her what
he had been doing.</p>

<p>She asked:</p>

<p>'Have you looked at pussy's eyes?'</p>

<p>10. 'They are funny eyes,' he said;
'they are green, but there is not much of
them to be seen.'</p>

<p>'Not just now,' said his mother, 'but
she can open them wide when she likes.
Then she can see even in the dark.'</p>

<p>11. 'In the dark, mother? Well, she
is not a bit like me!'</p>

<p>'No, she is not like you. But she has
plenty of cousins. Her cousins are the
big lions and tigers, that live in hot
countries, and eat sheep and horses, and
even people when they can get them.'</p>

<p>12. Harry thought a little, and then
said: 'If I were as small as pussy is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
now, and if pussy were as big as I am
now, I believe she would eat me!'</p>

<p>2. They shut the door; but, when they
opened it again, the dog was still there.</p>

<p>3. He looked so sad that they begged
their mother to give him some food.
Then they said: 'We can't turn him out
again to be hungry and lonely! Let us
keep him till some one comes for him.'
And very soon all three were happy at
play in the garden.</p>

<p>4. The cat sat up on a window-sill, and
looked at them. She did not seem to
like the fun. What a noise they all made!</p>

<p>5. 'How much nicer he is to play with
than pussy!' said Dora. 'He is not nearly
so lazy as pussy.</p>

joy! Now, if pussy wags her tail, it
means that she is cross. But I think I
like her round face better than his

bright he is, and how he looks as if
he would like to do something for us!'</p>

<p>8. 'That is because we have been kind
to him. Hi, good dog!' and Dora threw
her ball to the very end of the garden,
and watched her new friend run after it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

the fields, running races, picking flowers,
and making daisy-chains!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>2. When they began to feel tired and
hungry, they got milk and cake out of
mother's basket, and had a long rest on
the dry, warm grass.</p>

<p>3. 'How these buttercups shine!' said
Dora; 'they look like gold!'</p>

<p>'Gold-cups, they ought to be called,
not butter-cups,' said Harry. 'They look
like cups, don't they?'</p>

like real cups. Look at this one; it is
in five pieces.'</p>

There is another sort of cup
with five leaves in it.'</p>

green and hairy.'</p>

found the five yellow leaves. It is my

thick.'</p>

the bottom, but has a little bent horn at
the top.'</p>

<p>9. 'They must be seeds. I will break<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

'plants have seeds.'</p>

Harry.</p>

is only a case to take care of the

<p>1. There was a very little field at the
bottom of the garden, and father made
up his mind to grow wheat in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>2. A friend kindly lent him a horse
and plough, and the soil was quickly
turned over. A few days afterwards the
seed was sown.</p>

<p>3. The children helped to do this.</p>

<p>They got up very early one morning
and went out with their father. Harry
had a bag full of wheat, and Dora had a
little basket.</p>

<div class='center'><div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/illus-011.jpg" width="474" height="400" alt="" title="" />

<p>4. They watched what their father did,
then dipped their hands into the wheat,
and threw it out over the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>5. After that, the horse came again
with a harrow, to cover the seed over
with soil, and it was left to grow.</p>

<p>6. It seemed strange to think that
those little hard grains would grow up
to be tall plants and have other grains
upon them.</p>

<p>7. 'I hope we shall have some nice
soft rain,' said father, as they left the
field.</p>

<p>8. Many days went by, rain came
again and again. There was sunshine,
too; but sometimes the east winds blew.</p>

<p>9. Dora and Harry went out every
morning to look at the field. But they
always came in saying that there was
nothing but brown earth to be seen.</p>

<p>10. At last, one morning they came in
running and jumping. 'Our wheat is
up! There are tiny green leaves all over
the field!'</p>

<p>11. After this there was always something
fresh to see. The wheat-plants
grew taller, and put out long leaves.</p>

<p>12. Dora said one day that they looked
like grass, and her mother told her
that wheat was a large kind of grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>'Look at the shape of the leaves,' she
said, 'and the joints in the stems.'</p>

<p>13. The wheat soon grew so tall that it
stood above the heads of the children.
They used to go in among it, and make
believe that they were lost in a great
forest.</p>

<p>14. One day, when they were lost like
this, they saw that the tops of the
stalks had opened. Inside there were
green stems with green ears upon them.</p>

<p>1. Every day the ears grew larger and
harder, and then they began to look
yellow.</p>

<p>2. The children, too, heard their
father and mother talking about their
golden grain, and saying it was ripe.</p>

<p>3. At last, one very hot day, they
found that the time had come to cut the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
wheat. A kind friend came to help, and
Harry and Dora and the new dog jumped
about and ran in and out, and thought
that they helped too.</p>

<p>4. The children talked much about
their harvest, and mother made them a
harvest-supper. What a day it was!</p>

<p>5. It seemed so odd to have a bin
full of grain just like the grain they
had sown in the spring.</p>

<p>6. And now there was a great surprise
for them. A railway-man came with a
heavy box on a truck, and when the box
was opened, what do you think there
was inside?</p>

<p>A mill&mdash;a fine new wheat-mill!</p>

<p>7. 'We do not need now to go to the
miller!' said mother, looking very glad.
'We are going to have a miller in our
own house&mdash;no, two millers, I ought to
say!'</p>

<p>8. 'Two millers!' cried Harry.</p>

<p>'Do you mean Harry and me?' asked
Dora.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear children, I mean you.
You are going to be my dusty millers!</p>

<p>9. 'I will show you how much you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
are to grind, just a little every day.
You must put it into this big red pan,
and cover it up, and when I want to
bake I shall always have plenty of flour
ready.</p>

<p>10. 'And listen! You shall have a
penny each every week for doing the
work.'</p>

<p>At this Dora and Harry jumped for
joy, clapped their hands, and ran to their
mother to hug her.</p>

<p>11. Then she put some of the wheat
into the mill, took hold of the handle,
and made the wheel go round. Harry
next took his turn, and Dora hers, and
in a few minutes they found in the box
below a heap of nice soft flour.</p>

<p>12. 'Now,' said mother, 'let us give
father a treat when he comes home!
We will make some nice cakes with this
flour, and have them for tea! Grind a
little more, dear millers, while I make
up the fire.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

turned it over, rubbed their fingers on it,
and said they did not know.</p>

or like stone, or is it metal like the poker?
Is it a kind of wood, do you think? Did
it ever grow?'</p>

stone,' said Harry, 'only very smooth

<p>1. 'I should like to see a rock all made
of slate! Have you ever seen one,
mother?'</p>

<p>'Yes, many, dear. But there are
none near.' Then she laughed a little.
'But if you like to go just outside the
door you will see rows and rows of slates.'</p>

<p>2. Out they ran, looked all over the
ground, then at the garden-wall, then
back at their mother, who had come to
the door.</p>

<p>'Look at the house,' she said, 'look
higher!'</p>

<p>3. 'Oh, we never thought of the roof,'
they cried, and ran in again laughing.
'But those slates are not so nice and
smooth as our slates.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>'Your slates are made smooth on
purpose. Besides, they are made of
better slate&mdash;older slate. The older the
slate is the better it is.'</p>

<p>4. 'How old?'</p>

<p>'No one knows. It is a long story,
and no one can tell it properly. Shall I
tell you as much as I know?'</p>

<p>'Yes, do, please, mother!' and the two
settled themselves at her feet.</p>

<p>5. 'Well,' she began, 'once upon a
time there was a great stir at the bottom
of the sea. The heat and gas under the
ground broke through and pushed out
everything that was in the way.</p>

<p>6. 'Stones, ashes, and dust came flying
up through the water, and then fell
back into the water again. When all
was quiet, they settled down at the
bottom of the sea, and became mud.</p>

<p>7. 'All this happened many times, till
there was a great deal of mud. Then,
little by little, the mud was covered up
by other things.'</p>

<p>8. 'What sort of things?'</p>

<p>'Dead fish, perhaps, and shells, and
sand and mud that had been brought by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rivers into the sea. These things lay on
the top of the mud and weighed it down.</p>

<p>9. 'The heat under the bottom of the
sea still kept up, and made the mud
very hot, and baked it through. At
last it gave a great push, and heaved
the mud up above the water, so that it
became dry land.</p>

<p>10. 'In other ways it was made harder
and harder, until it was turned into
rock. And now we call it slate.
Here is a bit of your old broken slate.
See if you can turn it into mud again!'</p>

<p>1. A few days after this, Dora and
Harry were going across the fields.
They saw a horse and cart standing, and
a man taking white stones out of the
cart and putting them over the ground.</p>

<p>2. 'Why, it is Joe!' they cried, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
they came nearer. 'Good-morning, Joe.
What are you doing?'</p>

<p>'Chalking this bit of land, you see.
You know what chalk is, do you?'</p>

<p>3. Harry and Dora picked up a piece
or two.</p>

<p>'Teacher writes on the blackboard
with chalk,' they said.</p>

<p>'Yes, you are right. It is used for
many things,' and he went on spreading
it over the field.</p>

<p>4. 'But what is it wanted here for,
Joe?'</p>

<p>'No chalk, no wheat!' said Joe.</p>

<p>'Father put no chalk on our field, and
we had such a heap of wheat!'</p>

<p>5. 'Yours is good land. This up here
has never been used for farming. It had
little old trees on it, you know, and they
were cut down and their roots dug out of
the ground; and now, look at it! It is
poor soil.'</p>

<p>6. 'How do you know it is poor?'</p>

<p>'Look at the field below, what a
nice brown it is! That will grow anything,
but this is all colours&mdash;black, red,
yellow, and green.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>7. 'I have been a long way to fetch this
chalk: I started off with old Dobbin this
morning before it was light, and got it
out of the chalk-pit.'</p>

<p>8. 'When we were fast asleep!' said
Dora.</p>

<p>'Then you don't buy chalk at a shop?'
said Harry.</p>

<p>Joe laughed.</p>

<p>'No; it comes out of the ground.'</p>

<p>'This is like the slate story,' said Dora.</p>

<p>Harry nodded.</p>

<p>9. 'But, Joe, I want to know how the
chalk makes the ground good.'</p>

<p>'I don't know how, but it does. If
it lies here for a year or more, the earth
will turn brown, and we can grow wheat
in it. Besides, chalk holds water, and so
it will keep the ground moist up here.'</p>

<p>10. 'How?'</p>

<p>'Well, when it rains, the water will not
run away through the earth, but will
stay in the lumps of chalk. Are you
going? Good-bye, then.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The children had much to say that
evening about Joe and the field. They
had brought home a lump of chalk.</p>

<p>2. 'I will show you something,' said
father, and he got a cup of vinegar,
crushed a little of the chalk, and dropped
it into the cup.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Fizz and bubble, bubble and fizz!</p>

<p>3. What was going on?</p>

<p>When the stir came to an end, the
chalk was not there!</p>

<p>'Part of it has gone off in gas,' their
father said. 'The rest is lime, and it is
mixed with the vinegar.'</p>

<p>4. 'We did not see any gas,' said
Harry.</p>

<p>'You can't see gas. It is like air. All
those bubbles were made by the gas. It
went out of the cup into the air.</p>

<p>'Now, get a cup of water. Come
along! Where is your chalk?'</p>

<p>5. Father rubbed some of it into the
water, and stirred it up. The water
now looked like milk.</p>

<p>Father poured it into the sink, and
showed Harry and Dora, at the bottom
of the cup, a great many tiny grains.</p>

<p>6. 'Those little round things,' he said,
'are shells.'</p>

<p>'Shells!' said Dora, trying to see them
better.</p>

<p>'Were live things ever in them?' asked
Harry, and put a finger into the cup to
fish some out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>7. 'Yes, long, long ago. That bit of
chalk had hundreds and hundreds of
shells in it. Now, mother, it is your
turn! I have had mine. What do you
know about chalk?'</p>

<p>8. Mother smiled and began: 'There
was once a very deep sea, full of live
things, little and big. And on the top
of the water were crowds of tiny things
in shells, that put out long arms like
threads to catch their food.</p>

<p>9. 'When they died they all dropped
to the bottom of the sea, and lay there.
The shells were so very little that they
made a sort of mud when they were
mixed with the water.</p>

<p>'And now the mud is dry, and we call
it chalk!'</p>

<p>1. Harry came running in one day
to say that he had seen a little animal in
the field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>2. 'It ran so fast, I could hardly see it.

Dora, but we could not find it. Now,
what do you think it could be, mother?'</p>

<p>3. Then in came Dora, 'It had a long
tail, and was very little, and made no
noise at all.'</p>

<p>4. 'It may have been a mouse,' said
their mother; 'very likely it was.'</p>

<p>'But mice live indoors, do they not,
and eat cheese, and run about in the
walls, and make holes?'</p>

said Harry. 'Do they ever
live out of doors?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>6. 'A good many do. There is a

it up on a stalk of wheat.'</p>

<p>7. 'I wish there
had been one in our
wheat!' said Dora.
'I should like to see
the little nest and
the baby-mice peeping
out. They must
be very, very small.'</p>

<p>8. 'Yes, the harvest-mouse
is the
very smallest four-footed
animal we
have. Then there is
a field-mouse with a long tail, and a field-mouse
with a short tail. Mr Short-tail
likes to nibble at young trees.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that is not our mouse! He had
a long tail.'</p>

<p>9. 'And then there is a wood-mouse.'</p>

<p>'Has he a short tail or long tail?'
asked Harry.</p>

<p>'Long. I must tell you about a man
who used to go out in the night in wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

doing when most of us were in bed.</p>

<p>10. 'One of the things he found out
was that field-mice could sing!'</p>

<p>'Don't they squeak?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and he often heard them go on
for hours making a kind of singing.</p>

<p>11. 'Sometimes they were close by him
as he lay on the ground, and he would
put out his hand to catch one. But
when he opened it again it was full of
grass or moss or leaves; and there was
no mouse.'</p>

<p>'Did he never catch one?'</p>

<p>'Never.'</p>

<p>1. Harry and Dora were coming home
with their mother from a long walk, when
they saw some rabbits playing about on
the grass.</p>

<p>2. They wished to stay and watch them,
and the three sat down on a log a little
way off.</p>

<p>'Oh, look at that one going into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
hole!' said Dora. 'See his funny tail.
Why is he going into a hole?'</p>

<p>3. 'That is his house,' said their
mother. 'I daresay he is sleepy and
wants to go to bed.'</p>

<p>'He goes early, then, like the birds?'</p>

<p>'Yes, about sunset. He gets up a
little before sunrise.</p>

<p>4. 'There goes another! They will
soon all be gone.'</p>

<p>'Then we can look at their houses?'</p>

<p>'Only at their front doors. If you
were to sit quite still over there in the
day-time, you would see the rabbits
popping in and out.</p>

<p>5. 'After a time they would find out
that you were their friends, and then you
would be able to watch their doings.'</p>

<p>6. Then mother told them more about
the man who often stayed out all night
to see what animals did. 'One morning,
before it was quite light, he heard a tap-tap
near him, and saw a rabbit beating
on the ground with his hind-feet close to
another rabbit's hole.</p>

<p>7. 'He saw him go to another hole
and tap there, and then to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Some holes he passed and did not knock
at all.</p>

<p>'At last he had just begun tap-tapping
in front of a hole, when out rushed a big
rabbit. They began to fight, and they
both rolled down to the bottom of the
hill.</p>

<p>8. 'The man often saw rabbits tapping
like this. Sometimes two or three would
come out to speak to the one that tapped,
and they seemed to have a friendly chat.</p>

<p>9. 'There was another sound they
could make with their hind-feet. If
one of them made it, the others would
run into their holes as fast as they
could. It meant danger.'</p>

<p>'What was it like?' asked Dora.</p>

<p>1. Some sprigs of ivy had been standing
all the winter in a vase. The water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
had often been changed, and the leaves
washed.</p>

<p>2. When spring came each spray began
to put out buds. The buds were not all
at the ends of the sprays, but came out
also close to the old leaves.</p>

<p>3. At last there was a very small bud
between every old leaf and the stem.
When the first bud opened into a leaf,
Dora and Harry clapped their hands, and
called every one to look.</p>

<p>4. 'How clean and sweet it is!' cried
Dora. 'And do you see something like
wool or hair on it?'</p>

<p>'How curly it is!' said Harry. 'It is
not quite open yet. Why, it is like a
hand! All the leaves look rather like
hands, don't they? See; one, two, three,
four, five!'</p>

<p>5. 'Look at this old leaf against the
light,' said the mother; 'now you can
see the five long fingers. But people call
them ribs, not fingers! They are for
the purpose of keeping the leaf spread
out.'</p>

<p>6. 'Like the ribs of an umbrella,'
said Harry. 'They seem very strong;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the middle one, which goes up straight
from the stem, is the strongest of all.'</p>

<p>7. Dora was holding up one spray after
another to the light. 'What are all
these pretty marks on the leaves, mother,
lines crossing about all ways?'</p>

<p>'Those are veins, dear. They carry
the sap that feeds the leaves.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>8. 'What is sap?'</p>

<p>'The blood of plants and trees.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' said Dora, 'then that is the wet
that comes out when I pick a flower or
cut a leaf!</p>

<p>9. 'But look at this!' and she held up
one of the sprays.</p>

<p>At the end of it was a little bunch of
white, curly roots. Each root was not
much thicker than a thread.</p>

<p>10. 'Don't touch them,' said the
mother; 'roots are very tender things.'</p>

<p>'What is the good of them?' asked
Dora.</p>

<p>'What is your mouth useful for?'
asked her mother.</p>

<p>11. 'Oh, do you mean that the ivy
eats and drinks?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that is what I mean. These
roots take out of the water, or out of
the earth, all sorts of things good for
the food of the plant. They then send
them up into the stem and on into the
leaves.'</p>

<p>12. 'Mother,' said Harry, 'let us go
and plant all this ivy. I am sure it
wants to try the taste of the earth!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>1. 'Let us go over to that log where
we sat when we saw the rabbits,' said
Dora to Harry.</p>

<p>2. 'All right! We can play at ship,
and the grass shall be the sea.'</p>

<p>'Or we can have see-saw, if we can
find some wood to lay across the log.'</p>

<p>3. They were soon at the log, and on it
they sat down, and looked about them.</p>

<p>The log was the trunk of an old oak,
and a little way off stood the stump, with
many new shoots and leaves coming out
all round it.</p>

<p>4. Dora went and stood on it, and
called out that she was on a hill. She
jumped off and on a few times, and then
said it would make a good table, and
they might have tea on it.</p>

<p>5. Harry found that the stump had
roots that spread out all round for a
long way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>'How thick and hard they are!' he
said; 'come and feel this one!'</p>

<span class="caption">It is all marked in rings.</span>
</div></div>

<p>'It is not like the roots we saw on the
ivy,' she said. 'Now look at the top of
the stump. It is all marked in rings.'</p>

<p>6. 'In the very middle there is a little
light spot, and then come dark rings,
and then more rings outside. Father
once told me these rings showed how old
the trees were. And do you see lines
coming away from the middle?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>7. 'They look like the rays of the sun,
which I draw on my slate,' said Dora.
'What a rough coat this tree had!
Come and feel the outside of the log.'</p>

<p>'That is the bark! I have heard
father talk about bark.'</p>

<p>8. 'Well, I shall call it the coat. It is
the tree's overcoat to keep him warm
and dry. But trees do not all seem to
have rough coats. Look at that one!'
and she ran over to a little birch, and
pulled off some of its thin bark.</p>

<p>9. 'I have found a fine tree!' cried
Harry; and Dora came running to look
at it.</p>

<p>10. It was a beech, with a great round
smooth trunk and long strong branches.
Harry jumped up and caught at a leaf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
or two, and then went to pick an oak-leaf.
He laid them side by side on his hand
and looked at them, and found they were
not at all alike.</p>

<p>1. Two men were making a wall by
the road-side, and Harry and Dora
stopped to look at them.</p>

<p>2. Another man was going away
with a horse and cart. The cart was
empty, but it had been full of red bricks.
The men were putting these bricks
on the wall and making them fast with
mortar.</p>

<p>3. Dora liked the sound which the
trowel made when it struck against the
wall. Harry picked up one of the bricks
and looked at it, and then Dora must
look at one too.</p>

<p>4. They found that the bricks were
light and easy to lift. They also saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
that they were all of the same size and
shape, as if they had been made, and
not dug out of the ground.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-022.jpg" width="500" height="429" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>5. They did not like to ask the men
about them, and so they put the bricks
down, and set off on their way home.</p>

<p>6. As they went they met their
teacher, who stopped and spoke to
them, so Harry asked her to tell them
what bricks really were.</p>

<p>7. 'I wish there were a brick-field
near,' she said, 'and then we would go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and see it! But I can tell you a little
about it.</p>

<p>8. 'Bricks are made of clay, and clay
is dug out of the ground. Men dig it
before winter comes, and let it lie out
all the winter, and the frost breaks it
up nicely for them.</p>

<p>9. 'The next thing is to mix it well
into a paste, and then it is put into
moulds.'</p>

<p>'What are moulds?' Harry asked.</p>

<p>'Well, these moulds are like boxes with
no bottom or top.'</p>

<p>'Only sides, then?' said Dora.</p>

<p>10. 'Yes, they have two long sides,
and two short ones, and they hold the
soft, wet clay.</p>

<p>'You may call them clay-puddings
before they are put into the hot oven.
When they are taken out, what do you
think they are? They are bricks!'</p>

<p>1. At the bottom of the lane lived a
donkey. Harry and Dora knew him
well. They often met him going to town
with a load of fruit, and they saw him
in the lane every day cropping the grass
and thistles by the hedge-side.</p>

<p>2. He knew them, too, for they would
stop to pat his rough sides, or give him
an apple or a carrot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>3. They wondered how he could eat
such prickly things as thistles. A horse
would never touch them.</p>

<p>4. One day his master took him into
the garden while he was working. He
let Neddy go up and down the paths and
crop the grass, which had grown long on
the little grass-plot.</p>

<p>5. The donkey did not once try to get
at the pears and apples; he did not
even look at them.</p>

<p>6. His master was pleased, and said
to his wife: 'It is quite safe to leave the
gate open, and let Neddy come into the
garden when he likes. I shall be away
to-morrow, but you need not look after
him. He will be all right.'</p>

<p>7. Next day, Neddy walked into the
garden, found that no one was there,
and began to eat the fruit. He had
a good feast before his mistress saw him
from the window.</p>

<p>8. Then he was driven out, and the
gate was shut. After that he always
had to find his dinner in the lane.</p>

<p>9. The children saw him one day feeding
with a white horse that had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
down from the farm, and they stopped
to talk to them.</p>

<p>10. Then Dora said to Harry:</p>

<p>'They are like each other, and yet not
like! Neddy has a shaggy coat.'</p>

<p>'And his mane is short, and stands
up.'</p>

<p>'His ears are very long.'</p>

<p>'His tail is not like Snowflake's tail;
and, see, it has a little tuft at the end
of it!'</p>

<p>'And Snowflake is much taller.'</p>

<p>1. The next time that Dora and Harry
were out, they ran up to the place where
they had met Joe. They wished to see
how the chalk was getting on, and
whether the earth was brown yet.</p>

<p>2. After that they went over a stile
into a field where many sheep were
feeding. The sheep began to move away
when they saw the boy and girl coming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Then said Harry: 'Let us try
mother's plan of keeping quite still and
letting them see that we don't want to
hurt them.'</p>

<p>4. So they sat down under a hedge
and looked at the sheep for a long
time, and soon one and another began
to come near, eating away at the
grass.</p>

<p>5. 'I like that sound of tearing off the
grass, don't you?' said Dora.</p>

<p>'Do you see they swallow it all at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
once?' said Harry. 'What would mother
say to us if we ate without chewing?'</p>

<p>6. 'There is some chewing going on,
though. Look over there!' and she
showed him some sheep that were lying
down in the grass.</p>

<p>7. 'Oh, now I know! Don't you remember,
Dora, father told us once what
the cow does. It was that day we had
tea at the farm.'</p>

<p>8. 'No, I don't remember. We saw
the cows milked, and I had some new
milk in a glass. I don't think father
told me!'</p>

<p>9. 'Yes, he did. You must have forgotten.
He said that the cow sent her
food down into a big bag inside, and
then it went into a smaller bag, where
it was rolled up into little balls. And
when the cow lay down to rest, she
brought them up into her mouth and
chewed them well.'</p>

<p>10. 'I should think the sheep must be
doing the same thing. Look at this fat
one close by! She is just sitting down.
Now watch!'</p>

<p>'Yes, I can see her chewing! How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

liked it, don't they?'</p>

It was only a round rind: all the inside
had been eaten out.</p>

<p>'Now I am a sheep!'</p>

<p>1. Dora was alone in the garden. She
had played about till she was tired, when
she found herself close to the bed of
peas. She had seen her father sow the
peas, and now there were tall plants
with leaves and flowers and green tendrils.</p>

<p>2. Dora unrolled one or two of these
tendrils, and then watched them roll up
again. She thought:</p>

<p>'How funny it is of the plant to put
these out on purpose to take hold of the
sticks! And how pretty the flowers are!
They look like little white butterflies.
I will pull one open.'</p>

<p>3. She picked a flower, and sat down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with it on the grass. Inside of it she
found something long and green. This
she opened, and saw a row of tiny green
balls.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="caption">Pea-flower.</span>
</div></div>

<p>4. Not one of them was half as big as
a pin's head. They were all in a row,
and Dora counted seven of them.</p>

<p>She picked out each one and laid
them on her hand to look at.</p>

<p>5. Then it came into her mind that
these little mites of things must be baby-peas.
And she felt sorry to think what
she had done, for she could not put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
them back into their nest, and now they
would never grow up to be big.</p>

<p>6. She told Harry about it next day,
and he said, yes, it was very true. But
he must pull open just one flower himself
and see the peas inside; and so he
did. There were six peas in his flower.</p>

<p>7. Every day after this, Dora and
Harry came to look at the plants.</p>

<p>For a long time the flowers were
very pretty. Then they began to wither.
One by one they dropped off; but the
inside part of each stayed on, looking
green and shiny.</p>

<p>8. The children called these shiny
green things bags, till they heard some
one say that they were pods.</p>

<p>Sometimes they touched them. They
soon began to feel the peas inside. The
pods grew larger and fatter every day.</p>

came out with a basket and began to

three were soon at
work.</p>

<p>2. Next, the shelling
began. Mother
had a basin in her
lap, and the two
children sat close to
her and shelled their
peas into it.</p>

<p>3. They told her
how they had shelled
the baby-peas. She
taught them how
each plant was a living thing, and had
a tiny plant inside of it, all ready to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
come out at the right time. This was
very wonderful.</p>

<p>4. 'Did that big plant come out of
one little pea?' cried Dora.</p>

<p>'I can't see a little plant inside,' said</p>

<p>Harry, breaking one of the peas open.</p>

<p>5. 'Yet it is there, a fairy-plant, with
a root, a stem, and two leaves. These
leaves take up nearly all the room in the
green ball. How would you like to have
two or three of these peas to plant?
There! I can spare you three each from
to-day's dinner.'</p>

<p>6. The children were glad to have
them. 'I wish we could see them grow,'
said Dora. 'What happens, mother,
when they are in the earth?'</p>

<p>7. 'Do you mean, How do they begin
to grow? Well, the weather must be
rather warm, and the earth moist, and
the pea swells itself out till it bursts
open its thin coat. The little root goes
down to fasten it firmly in the ground,
and to look for food. Then the little
stem and the two leaves come up to
get air and sunshine. That is how it
begins.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>8. 'What food is there in the ground?
What food do the roots find?'</p>

<p>'Lime and iron'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Iron!' cried Harry.</p>

<p>9. 'Yes, there is iron in green peas!
There are sugar, too, and starch, and fat,
and water, and other things. Some come
out of the earth, some come out of the
air and the sunlight, and some the plant
makes for itself. Oh, it is a very clever
plant! But all plants are clever, I think.'</p>

<p>1. 'What have you in your pockets,
father?' asked Harry, pulling at them.
'Nuts? stones? marbles?'</p>

<p>'Put your hand in, and find out. Here,
Dora, you can try the other pocket.'</p>

<p>2. In went two hands, and out came
little hard lumps, each wrapped in paper.
The children laid them on the table in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

were.</p>

<p>3. They were not nuts, nor marbles,
and not quite like stones. They were
all about the same size, but one was
very heavy. Harry and Dora held it in
their hands to feel how heavy it was.</p>

<p>4. 'That is a bit of lead,' said their
father. 'Which do you think is the next
in weight?'</p>

<p>'This red one. It is a good deal lighter,
though!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>'That is called copper. Now, what
comes next?'</p>

<p>5. They were not sure, but thought
that iron came next, and then tin,
and then zinc. Their father told them
these names as they went on. He
told them also that all these things
were metals, and had been dug out of
the earth.</p>

<p>6. 'Suppose we make a box to keep
them in?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes!' cried both.</p>

<p>'And if we find any more things like
these, we will put them in.</p>

<p>7. 'Would you put in a buttercup?'</p>

<p>'No, no!'</p>

<p>'Or a grain of wheat?'</p>

<p>'No, it is not at all like these.'</p>

<p>'Or a bit of slate?'</p>

<p>'I think so,' said Harry.</p>

<p>Dora was not quite sure.</p>

<p>8. 'Yes, we will put the slate into the
box. It is not a metal, but it came out
of the ground. Now, what do you say
to this?' And he pulled out a lump
that looked like earth and stone.</p>

<p>9. What could this be? It was iron,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
just as it had come out of the ground,
with clay and earth about it.</p>

<p>10. 'Once upon a time,' said father,
'the kettle, and the poker, and the
fender, all looked like this!'</p>

<p>1. Harry and Dora once had a great
treat.</p>

<p>They went in the holidays to stay
with an uncle and aunt who lived at
a town where needles were made. We
may call it Needle-town.</p>

<p>2. While they were there, they were
taken to the mills to see the needles made.</p>

<p>3. The first room into which they
went was very warm. It was called the
wire-room. A workman who was there
told them that it was filled with hot
air night and day, so that no damp
should come in and spoil the steel.</p>

<p>4. All round the room coils of steel-wire
were hanging. They were wrapped
up in paper, but the man took some of
them down and let them look in. They
saw that one coil was of very thick wire,
while another was of wire as fine as a hair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>5. 'One of these coils would be more
than a mile long if it were stretched out
straight,' the man told Harry. 'Would
you like to take hold of this one?'</p>

<p>But Harry found it too heavy, and it
was hung up again on the wall.</p>

<p>6. Then they went into another room,
where a machine was cutting a coil of
wire into bits.</p>

<p>'They are much too long for needles,'
said Dora, softly, to her uncle; but one
of the workmen heard her, and said:</p>

<p>7. 'So they are! Each bit is going to
be two needles. The two ends are to
be the points, and the heads lie in the
middle of the wire.'</p>

<p>8. But no heads were to be seen yet.
And the wire was not even straight, for
it had long been rolled up in a coil. As
the machine went on chopping, and the
wire-strips dropped, a man picked them
up and put them on a shelf in a sort
of oven.</p>

<p>9. There they were kept till they were
red-hot, and then they were soft enough
to be made straight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The next thing that the children
saw was a grindstone turning round
very, very fast.</p>

<p>2. A man put the bits of wire into a
thing which was fixed just over the
grindstone, and both ends were quickly
rubbed sharp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>3. 'Now you see the points of the
needles,' said the man, as the wire came
out again.</p>

<p>'But there are no heads yet!' said
Harry.</p>

<p>'And no eyes!' said Dora.</p>

<p>'Well, come along to the stamping-room,'
said their uncle.</p>

<p>4. In this room they found a block of
stone that had iron on the top of it.
Over it hung a heavy hammer. A man
who stood there took one of the wires,
put it on the block, and made the
hammer come down upon it.</p>

<p>5. The moment the hammer went up
again the wire fell into a pan, and the
children were allowed to look at it.</p>

<p>6. Still there were no eyes or heads!
All that could be seen were two little
dents, one on each side of the middle
of the wire.</p>

<p>7. 'But, look again!' said uncle.
'Don't you see a tiny dot in each dent?
That is where the eye is going to be.'</p>

<p>8. In the next room they found a
great number of boys at work.</p>

<p>'Oh, uncle,' said Harry, 'do you think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
I could come here and help to make
needles?'</p>

<p>'You would soon be tired of it,' said
his uncle, laughing.</p>

<p>9. They went up to one of the boys,
and watched him for some time. He
took some wires that had come from
the stamping-room, and laid them on a
piece of iron, but held the two ends in
his hands.</p>

<p>10. Then a heavy thing with two hard,
sharp, steel points under it came down
on the middle part of the wires, and made
two holes just where the dots had been.</p>

<p>1. They went on into another room.
Here there were boys again! And what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
were the boys doing? They were
threading the wires together.</p>

<p>2. When they were all strung together,
they looked like a long tooth-comb.
The heads were in the middle, and the
points lay on either side.</p>

<p>3. The boys took them to some of the
workmen, and these men made the
middle part quite smooth. Rough edges
had been left along the tiny dents, and
had to be rubbed down.</p>

<p>4. When this was done, a man made a
line along the middle of the 'comb,' and
then gently bent it backwards
and forwards till
it broke right in the
middle.</p>

</div></div>

<p>5. Harry and Dora were
glad to see this. Each bit
of wire looked like a needle now. It
had a head of its own, and an eye, and
a point.</p>

<p>6. The next thing was to make the
needles hard. Dora and Harry thought
they looked quite hard already, but they
did not know.</p>

<p>7. How were they hardened? They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
were first laid on iron plates and put
into a kind of oven.</p>

<p>'This is the second baking they have
had,' said Harry.</p>

<p>They were kept in till they were
white-hot.</p>

<p>8. When the needles came out, they
were put into cold water! What a
hissing and steaming they made! But
they had to lie there till they were quite
cool.</p>

<p>9. Then they were taken out and
dried. The man said they were hard
enough now, but something else must
be done to them to make them able to
bend well without breaking.</p>

<p>10. They were put on an iron plate
over a fire, and gently moved about.
Some of them curled up, and had to be
taken off.</p>

<p>11. They were given to a woman, who
was sitting on a bench with a little
hammer in her hand and a small steel
block in front of her. She laid a curly
needle on the block, and hammered it
till it was straight, and then another,
and another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The cleaning of the needles came
next.</p>

<p>2. A great many were laid side by
side on a piece of canvas, and covered
with paste.</p>

<p>'What is the paste made of?' Harry
wanted to know.</p>

<p>'Soft soap, my lad,' said the workman,
'and oil, and emery-powder.'</p>

<p>3. He rolled them all up in the
canvas, tied string round the bundle, and
put it between the rollers of a thing
that looked like a mangle.</p>

<p>4. Dora and Harry opened their eyes
wide. 'Think of needles being mangled!
This will be something to tell mother!'</p>

<p>5. When the bundle was unrolled, they
were afraid that the needles would be
broken. But they were all right, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
they were taken out and washed in
warm soap-suds.</p>

<p>6. 'Now they must be clean!' said Dora.</p>

<p>'Not yet,' said the man; 'they have
to be rolled up again with more paste,
and put between those rollers again, and
again, and again. It takes eight days
to clean the best needles.</p>

<p>7. 'And it takes six days to clean the
second-best,' said the man.</p>

<p>'Then even the second-best won't be
done till Friday!' said Harry.</p>

<p>8. 'But we can go and see some
needles that have been cleaned,' said
his uncle. 'Let us go up-stairs again.'</p>

<p>9. And they went up into a room
where many girls were sitting at a long
table with heaps of bright needles before
them. They were putting them in order,
side by side, heads all one way, points
another.</p>

<p>Dora was sure that she could not pick
them out so quickly.</p>

<p>10. They were going on into another
room to see the eyes of the needles
made smooth, when Dora said, 'Oh, uncle,
I am so tired!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>'So am I,' said Harry, 'and hungry,

laughing. 'We all want our dinners, I
think.' He took Dora's hand in his, and

<p>1. There was not much talking at
dinner, till after the second helping
of roley-poley.</p>

<p>2. Then Dora and Harry felt happy
again, and began to tell their aunt all
about the needle-making. She had seen
it once, but it was a long time ago,
and she thought she should like to see
it again.</p>

<p>3. 'But if I had gone this morning,'
she said, 'you would not have had your
pudding.'</p>

<p>'That would have been sad,' said
Dora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>4. 'What a lot of steel we have seen,'
said Harry. 'I never knew there was
so much in the world.'</p>

<p>5. 'You can see some on this table now.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'What have I cut the pudding with?'</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-034.jpg" width="500" height="423" alt="" title="" />
</div></div>

<p>'Oh, the knife! Yes, I see; that must
be steel; at least, that part of it. What
do you call that part?'</p>

<p>'The blade.'</p>

<p>6. 'And what about the handle?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>'I don't know. It is yellow, and
smooth, and hard.'</p>

<p>'It is bone,' said his uncle, 'part of
an ox-bone. But some handles are made
of wood.'</p>

<p>7. 'May I look at that knife near you,
auntie? I mean the clean one. Thank
you!'</p>

<p>8. Then Dora wanted one to look at
too; and they felt the edges softly and
found them very sharp. They looked
at the blunt backs of the blades, and
then tried to read the maker's name.</p>

<p>9. 'There is no room to put the
maker's name on a needle,' said Harry.
'But how do they get it on here?'</p>

<p>'It is stamped on when the blade is
red-hot and rather soft.'</p>

<p>10. They could not make out how the
handle was put on, so their aunt went
to the knife-box and got out an old knife
that had lost its handle. They saw
that the blade had a long thin piece of
iron at the end of it.</p>

<p>11. 'A long hole is made inside the
handle, and this iron thing is put into
it, and made fast.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>So their uncle said, and then looked
at the clock and saw that it was time
for him to go.</p>

<p>1. The day after Dora and Harry came
home, their mother gave them a basket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and sent them up to the farm to fetch
eggs.</p>

<p>2. Rover went with them, and all
three were glad to go, for they had
many friends at the farm.</p>

<p>3. There was the great dog, Watch,
and there were the cart-horses and the
pony, the ducks and the fowls. And
there were five girls and boys&mdash;Mary,
Tom, Johnny, Annie, and Kate.</p>

<p>4. When these five, and Watch, saw
Harry, Dora, and Rover coming, they
ran down the lane to meet them. They
were soon all in the farm-yard, talking
as fast as they could talk.</p>

<p>5. Two had to tell about their visit to
Needle-town, and five about the doings
at the farm, so it was some time
before the eggs were thought of.</p>

<p>6. Mary had charge of the eggs, and
went every morning to look for new ones.</p>

<p>'Since you went away,' she said, 'I
have had a pair of bantams given me,
for my very own. Here they are!'</p>

<p>'What little things! and how very
pretty!' cried Dora. 'Do they know you,
Mary?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>7. 'Yes; I feed them every day. Here
comes the big black hen. She has been
laying an egg. See how proud she is!
She calls out in that way to let the
rest know what she has done.'</p>

<p>8. 'Now she is pecking about for
food,' said Harry.</p>

<p>Tom said that fowls were always
eating.</p>

<p>'They are greedy things,' said Kate.</p>

<p>9. 'Oh, look at this gray hen!' said
Harry, 'she picked up a bit of stone just
now and ate it! Does she know no
better?'</p>

<p>10. 'It is not for food,' Mary told him;
'she takes it to grind up the hard seeds
she has swallowed. They all go into a
strong little bag, and the stones rub
and press on the seeds.'</p>

<p>11. 'I never heard of such a thing!
She keeps a mill inside to grind her
food!'</p>

<p>12. The others laughed, and then Mary
went in to get some eggs. After the
basket was filled, the two children said
good-bye to their friends, and went
home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>1. 'Mother,' cried Harry, running in
one day, 'Jack Denny says he shoots
sparrows!'</p>

<p>'I am very sorry to hear it. Why
does he shoot them?'</p>

<p>'"They steal fruit and corn," he says.
He wanted me to throw stones at
them!'</p>

<p>2. 'Well, you can tell him about some
silly men who killed the sparrows and
other birds, and the next year their fruit
and corn were eaten up by grubs. Even
the leaves on the trees were eaten.'</p>

<p>3. 'Is this true?'</p>

<p>'Quite true. They had to send for
little birds from other places to live in
their fields and gardens. Do you know
that a sparrow kills four thousand grubs
in one day when her babies are in the
nest?</p>

<p>4. 'One wise man who grows fruit says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that his best friends are the sparrows,
and he makes holes in the garden-walls
for them to build in. Their sharp eyes
see the tiny things that would spoil the
fruit, and their sharp beaks nip them
up at once.</p>

<p>5. 'He loves to see sparrows in an
apple-tree in blossom-time; he knows
they are saving the apples for him.'</p>

<p>'But Jack says he has seen them
pecking at fruit.'</p>

<p>6. 'Yes, they like fruit, just as you
and I do. But there would be no fruit
at all, if the birds did not eat the grubs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>7. 'The man I was telling you about
puts nets over his trees when the fruit
begins to ripen. And I heard only the
other day that it is a good plan to put
pans of clean fresh water close to the
trees and bushes. Then the birds will
not go so often to the fruit. They are
thirsty and hot, poor things!</p>

<p>8. 'And there would be no corn, if
the birds did not kill the wheat-fly's
grubs.'</p>

<p>9. When Harry heard all this, he
made up his mind not to throw stones at
the sparrows, as Jack wanted him to do.</p>

<p>1. A little stream ran through one of
the farmer's fields. The water was so
clear that you could see
the sand and gravel at
the bottom, and in it
there grew plenty of
water-cress.</p>

<p>2. Harry went one
afternoon to help
Johnny and Tom to
pick it for market,
and brought a big
bunch home for tea.</p>

<p>3. His mother had
picked a lettuce from
the garden, and some mustard and cress,
and they were all put on one plate.</p>

<p>'They bite my tongue,' said Dora, 'all
but the lettuce. I like it best.'</p>

<p>4. 'And I like the biting,' said Harry.
'Why is this called mustard, mother?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>'Because the yellow mustard comes
from it. The seeds are ground to

leaves. It is a useful
plant.'</p>

<p>5. After tea,
mother took some
cress-seed and mustard-seed
out of two
little packets. Then
she cut up one or
two corks, put them
into a deep plate,
filled it with water, and sprinkled seed
on the cork.</p>

<p>6. 'This is for you, Harry,' she said.
'You will soon have a little crop of
mustard and cress. And here is one for
Dora!'</p>

<p>In Dora's plate she laid a bit of flannel,
poured water on it, and sowed seed. The
children carried off their plates to a safe
place, and thought it would be fine fun
to see roots and leaves come out of the
tiny seeds.</p>

<p>7. Then mother called them into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
garden to see her parsley. She told
them that hares and rabbits would come
a long way to feed on a parsley-bed if
they could get at it.</p>

<p>8. Close by grew mint, sage, and
thyme. 'All these are herbs,' she said.
'They are not like trees, are they?'</p>

<p>'No; they have no bark, no hard
wood, and they are so small.'</p>

see if they were like each other. But

that they were not alike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>1. 'What is coffee, mother dear? Does
it grow?'</p>

<p>2. It was Dora who asked this. She
and Harry were putting away some
things that had come from the shop,
and she was now filling a tin with coffee-beans.</p>

<p>3. She was kneeling on a chair by the
table in the window. Her mother was
busy mending stockings, and the cat
and the dog were both asleep. The kettle
was singing, and all was cosy.</p>

<p>4. The coffee-beans rattled into the tin,
and Dora picked one out and looked at it.</p>

<p>When Harry heard Dora asking
about it, he also put his hand in and
took a coffee-bean. It smelt very nice,
he thought. So did Dora.</p>

<p>5. They found that it had a flat side
and a round side.</p>

<p>'It humps up,' said Dora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>'See, I can put the flat side of mine
against the flat side of yours,' said

<p>'Oh yes! And we have played at
houses, and had the bricks out on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

and put them into this sack. The man
is coming soon to take it to the paper-mill.'</p>

Perhaps it will come back to us some

Dora. 'Perhaps it will go to some other
house.'</p>

<p>'That is quite likely,' said mother,
who was now cleaning the hearth.</p>

into the sack for a long time, and then
Harry asked:</p>

<p>'How was paper made before there
was old paper to make it of?'</p>

It is made of old rags, old ropes'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

grass'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now, are you joking, mother?'</p>

<p>11. 'No, indeed! They cut the wood

and tear the rags and boil them.'</p>

<p>'And what do they do with the grass?'</p>

told them a very strange thing, that his
eyes could see all ways at once!</p>

<p>1. There was a great stir at dinner
one day. A wasp came in, begging for
sugar and plum-tart. Harry and Dora
ran this way and that.</p>

<p>2. At last their father got the wasp out
into the garden, and, when all was quiet
again, he asked if they would like to
hear its story.</p>

<p>'Oh yes, father!' said Dora.</p>

<p>3. Harry was busy with his plums,
but he nodded, as much as to say, 'I
shall be glad to hear it too!'</p>

<p>4. So the father began:</p>

<p>'All last winter the wasp was asleep,
but when spring came she waked up
and set out to look for a home. I am
not quite sure where she found it, but it
was in the ground, I think.</p>

<p>5. 'She began to dig in the soft earth,
and she dug on till she had made a
long passage. She had to carry out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
all the loose earth herself. Then she
made a little room at the end of the
passage.</p>

<p>6. 'Next she looked about for some old
wood, and found it in a tree, perhaps, or
post, or bit of fence. She rubbed away
at it with her jaws till she got some of
it off in powder.</p>

<p>7. 'She made this powder into a paste
with a sort of gum which came out of
her mouth, and off she went with it to
her room.'</p>

<p>8. 'What did she do with it?'</p>

<p>'She spread it out in sheets of thin
brown paper, and with these she made
a comb like a bee's.'</p>

<p>'She made paper of it.'</p>

<p>'Only a bee's is made
of wax. I know that!'
said Harry.</p>

<p>9. 'She put many
layers of paper on the
top to keep the rain out,
and pillars under it to
hold it up. Then she
laid an egg in each cell. When the eggs
were hatched'&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'Little wasps came flying out,' said
Dora.</p>

<p>'No; little grubs came crawling
out!</p>

<p>10. 'The wasp was now more busy than
ever. She fed each baby in turn, and as
they all grew bigger she had to get more
and more food for them.'</p>

<p>1. It was very hot, the sky was blue,
and the air was full of the humming and
buzzing of bees and flies. A white
butterfly flitted by, but soon went away
over the garden-wall.</p>

<p>2. Bee after bee, and fly after fly,
settled on the sunflowers and hunted for
honey. Dora and Harry watched for a
long time.</p>

<p>3. 'The sunflower is like a little sun,'
said Dora.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>'And it loves the sun,' said her mother,
who was snipping off dead roses close
by; 'it always turns to look at it. See,
its face is towards the sun now. And if
you look again before sunset you will
find the flower turned to it still.'</p>

Harry. 'You would not think that it
could turn round. It must be alive!'</p>

<p>'Of course it is alive!'</p>

<p>'But, I mean, it must feel, or why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
should it turn and turn to get the light
and warmth?'</p>

<p>5. 'How ragged all the stalks and
leaves are!' said Dora. 'I wish they
would make themselves tidy instead of
always staring at the sun. Why are
there so many holes in the leaves?'</p>

<p>6. 'Grubs have been eating them.
Our friend Mr Sparrow must have been
away lately!'</p>

<p>7. Here mother stopped snipping at
her rose-trees, and came up to one of the
sunflowers.</p>

<p>8. 'There is something I want you to
see,' she said. 'You think this is one big
flower, but it is really a crowd of little
flowers. Look! Can you think of
another flower that is something like it?'</p>

<p>9. Harry and Dora shook their heads.</p>

<p>'It is very small,' mother went on,
'with a cushion in the middle like this,
and rays standing out all round like these.'</p>

<p>10. 'Does it grow on a tree?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>1. Mother went back to her roses, and
soon called for a little basket, saying that
Dora and Harry should take a few to an
old woman who lived in the village.</p>

<p>2. 'Poor granny,' she said, 'is so
fond of roses, and she can never get out
now to see them. Which shall we pick
for her?'</p>

<p>3. 'Some of these white ones,' said
Dora.</p>

<p>'I think she would like these red ones,'
said Harry, 'they smell so sweetly.'</p>

then a moss-rose, which looked as if it
had moss growing round it, and then a
pink cabbage-rose.</p>

<p>5. 'What has it to do with cabbage?'
asked Harry.</p>

<p>'It is only called cabbage because it is
so big and round.'</p>

cup: 'it is such a nice rose!'</p>

with a smile, 'but I almost think I like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the wild ones best. Do you know that
the wild rose is the mother of all these?
Once upon a time all roses were wild.'</p>

<p>8. Harry and Dora did not think that
wild roses were very like garden roses.
'But they both have thorns,' they said.</p>

<p>9. 'Look at them as you go along.
There are some bushes not far from the
bottom of the lane, after you turn round
to go to the village. I don't think you
will find many roses left, but you will see
their fruit. They are the birds' fruit-trees.'</p>

<p>10. 'What can mother mean?' they
asked as they went along.</p>

<p>But they soon found out. The bushes
were covered with hips; some green,

<p>1. The little mineral box was made,
and Harry and Dora put in the lumps of
lead, iron, copper, tin, zinc, chalk, and
slate. Father wrote the names on tiny
slips of paper and gummed them on.</p>

<p>2. Then he said that he was going to
make Dora a doll's house. On hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
this, Dora first jumped about for joy, and
then climbed up on her father's knees to
kiss and hug him.</p>

<p>3. The doll's house was not made all at
once. It had to be done bit by bit in
the evenings after father had come home
from work and had his tea.</p>

<p>4. Dora and Harry always helped him,
or stood by and talked, played with bits
of wood, and turned over the tools in the
box.</p>

<p>5. They said that saw-dust should be
called wood-dust; and they found out
that wood was called tree when it was
alive, and tree was called wood when it
was dead. They thought this very funny.</p>

<p>6. They also learned that there were as
many kinds of wood as there were trees.</p>

<p>'Some wood is hard,' said their father,
'some is half-hard, and some is soft.'</p>

<p>'Soft wood!' cried Dora.</p>

<p>7. 'Well, not soft like butter! But
softer than oak, beech, birch, and
elm'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'The trunk of an oak-tree is lying
where the rabbits live,' said Harry, in
a great hurry. 'We often play on it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
I know that it is hard. What sort of
wood are you making the doll's house of?'</p>

<p>8. 'Soft wood. It is a bit of pine. So
is the box that holds the minerals. I
should find it hard work to cut oak.</p>

<p>'Now, there is one kind of wood so soft
that you can bend it. It is called willow,
and baskets are made of it.</p>

the great strong ships.'</p>

What fun it will be!'</p>

<p>2. Crash came the coal on the ground.
Then the coal-man drew his horse and
cart away, and set to work with a spade
to fill the little coal-place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

did not know how. Dora tumbled over
the heap and bumped her head, so she
thought she would be content with
watching Jim and Harry. But Harry
was soon tired, and Jim was left to go
on alone.</p>

he asked.</p>

<p>'Out of the ground, my lad.'</p>

<p>'You go down in a thing they call a

It is like going down a deep pit. They
call it a mine.'</p>

<p>7. 'Oh, I have heard of coal-mines!'</p>

<p>Dora was taking up one little lump of
coal after another, and wondering why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it was so shiny if it had really come out
of the earth.</p>

<p>1. Next day the children asked their
mother to tell them what coal really
was. Harry did not think it was a
stone, because he had broken two or
three lumps with a hammer. He found
that it broke much more easily than
stone.</p>

<p>2. Besides, it did not fly all into sharp
bits, but came off in slices; and he saw
that it had straight lines along it.
When he poked his knife in between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
these lines, he could take off a slice of
coal at once!</p>

<p>3. Dora did not think it was a metal,
because she had learnt that iron would
melt in a fire and flow like water. 'Coal
does not melt,' she said, 'every one knows
that!'</p>

<p>4. She took a small lump out of the
coal-box, and Harry did the same.
Mother then fetched some pictures, and
one or two other things, and the talk
began.</p>

<p>5. 'It is no wonder that you can't
guess what coal is! It does not look at
all like what it was at first. It was not
always in the ground; it used to live on
the top and get the air and sunshine.'</p>

<p>6. 'It must have been alive,' said
Harry. 'Was it an animal?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then it was a plant!' cried Dora.</p>

<p>7. 'Well, it is all that is left of many
plants and trees, whole forests of plants
and trees, that grew long, long ago.'</p>

<p>'Before you were born, mother?'</p>

<p>8. 'Yes, long before that! It was
hundreds and thousands of years ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
It was so far back that the trees were
not like the trees we have now. Many
of them were big
ferns. Think of a
fern grown up to be
a tree! And many
were great horse-tails.
You know
what a horse-tail is?'</p>

<p>9. 'Oh yes,' said
Dora, 'we find them
in the ditch down the
lane. It is such fun
pulling them to pieces
and putting them
together again&mdash;like
puzzles!'</p>

<p>1. 'Don't you think,' said Harry, 'that
a bit of coal would be a good thing for
our mineral box?'</p>

<p>2. 'I do,' said his father. 'Get a little
lump, and put it in. And, by the way,
we want more coal on the fire. I must
get some.'</p>

<p>3. 'How nice a fire is on a cold day!'
said Dora, sitting down on the fender, to
be as near to it as she could.</p>

<p>'Very nice,' said her mother, 'in its
proper place&mdash;in the grate.'</p>

<p>4. 'Ah, we should not like it to come
walking about the room!' said Harry,
laughing. 'There would soon be no
room'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'And no house!' said Dora, shaking
her head. 'And then what should we
do?'</p>

<p>5. Father came back with the coal,
and put some into the grate, saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>'Fire is a good servant but a bad
master. If it gets its own way it is a
cruel thing. It would burn a town
down. It once burned big London.'</p>

<p>6. Harry was looking at one of the
lumps that had been put on the fire.
Smoke was coming out of it already.
A flame burst out in front, and soon
the whole lump was in a blaze.</p>

<p>7. 'It seems such a pity that it should
all be burned up,' said Harry, 'when it
took so long to make.'</p>

<p>'That is the way of fire,' said father,
'it eats up everything, and when it has
nothing more to feed on it comes to an
end&mdash;it goes out, we say.'</p>

<p>8. 'We don't want it to go out, and so
we keep on feeding it,' said mother. 'It
is like a wild beast in a cage.'</p>

<p>'Now look at the coal!' said father.</p>

<p>9. By this time the lumps were red and
very hot. The children went down on
their knees to look for pictures in the
fire. They soon saw what looked like
men and dogs, rocks, hills, and trees,
and at last a great cat with red-hot eyes
and a very curly tail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The cat lives in and about our homes; so we call it a
domestic animal.</p>

<p>2. It belongs to the same tribe of animals as the lion
and tiger. They are savage&mdash;puss is tame. Like them,
it is a beast of prey&mdash;that is, it catches and eats other
animals. They cannot hear it coming with its soft, padded
feet.</p>

<p>3. The cat leaps upon its prey. It sticks its strong, sharp
claws into a mouse, and soon kills it with its sharp teeth.</p>

<p>4. Puss is covered with fur; she has five claws on each
fore-paw, and four on each hind one. She draws them
into little sheaths when not angry.</p>

<p>5. With its rough tongue the cat can lap up milk, and also
clean its fur. It likes to be clean. It opens its eyes wider
in the dark, and can see to run about at night. On each
side of its head are long whiskers, with which it feels its
way.</p>

<p>1. The dog is larger and more active than the cat. It is
also of more use to man, for it guards the house, minds
the sheep, and will not allow any one to harm its master.</p>

<p>2. There are many kinds of dogs. All are of some use&mdash;from
the large Newfoundland dog to the little fox-terrier.</p>

<p>3. Dogs are like cats in some things. They have padded
feet and strong claws. But their claws are blunt. They
cannot draw them into sheaths as puss does; so they make
more noise in walking.</p>

<p>4. The dog is also a beast of prey. But it is not so fierce as
the wolf or the fox, which belong to the same tribe of
animals. It likes meat and bones, but will also eat bread
and vegetables. Its teeth are very strong and sharp.</p>

<p>5. Most dogs have keen scent, pointed noses, and quick
sight.</p>

<p>1. Wheat is a plant of the <i>grass</i> kind, but grows higher
than common grass. It is grown from seed, which is grains
of wheat kept until hard and dry.</p>

<p>2. Ruts are made in the soil by a plough, and into these
the seed is cast. Then the soil is covered over them by a
harrow, drawn by a horse.</p>

<p>3. Rain and warm sunshine help the grains to grow. They
grow into tall, jointed stems, and soon the ears of wheat
appear. They are green at first, but the sun ripens them and
turns them yellow.</p>

<p>4. Then the wheat is cut, and the new grains are threshed
out from the husks which are called chaff. The tall stems
make straw. The grains are ground into flour by the miller.
We use flour for making bread, cakes, and puddings.</p>

<p>1. Slate is a kind of stone. Rocks, and even mountains, are
sometimes made of slate. The great hole made in the rocks
by getting it out, is called a quarry. It is got out in very
large blocks. Sometimes gunpowder is used to crack the rocks
before the blocks can be got out.</p>

<p>2. Slate is very hard and brittle. It is used for many purposes.
Houses are roofed with slates. Sometimes it is used for
pavements. It can be made so smooth that we use it for
writing upon. Slate-pencil is made from soft slate-stone.</p>

and soft. It is used for many purposes. The farmer puts it
on the fields sometimes, to make the soil better. It holds
water and keeps the soil moist.</p>

<p>2. We get lime and whiting from chalk. We use it in

used, too, for writing on the blackboard. Chalk is found in
many parts of England. Kent and Hampshire have most.
Chalk-pits are often seen in the hills.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
